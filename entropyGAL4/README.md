# GAL4-EntropyConservationAnalysis

**************************************

-> Please skip ***1)*** in the .ipynb directly, it has no relevance to this repository

-> reads sequences of GAL4 from a .txt file

-> calculates and plots entropy scores for sequence columns 

-> scales the scores to range[0-10] by using a Shannon-wise analogy

-> plots the sequences for conservation scores 

-> includes comments on structural & functional analysis of conserved regions
